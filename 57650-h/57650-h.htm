<p><i>Once, long ago, a peasant greatly desired to visit
his king that he might obtain of him judgment and
equity, and perhaps find favor. But he said within
himself, &#8220;I am a faulty man; a homespun smock will
scarce commend me to a king. I will stay at home
and let others plead my case.&#8221; And when his case
was taken before the king, (who was a good and just
man) the king said, &#8220;Why did he not come himself?
Homespun I can forgive if a man bring his soul and
stand before me bravely. I will have no dealings with
go-betweens.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>Here then, is my work, faulty, and plainly clad, but
brave enough to go humbly before you who read and
think, and by your thinking rule. If it find favor, it
can be clothed anew in finer raiment. If judgment and
equity prevail against it, surely it is well enough
shrouded.</i></p>

<h2>THE SCENE</h2>

<p><i>The World Field, at harvest time and set of sun.
On the right is The World Inn, and, in front of it,
on the ground, a prostrate figure, clad in black
and bound</i>, <span class="smcap">Soul of Man</span>. <i>On the left, near the
front, are trees and flowers, piles of fruit and vegetables,
a wagon load of grain, and, in the foreground,
a tangle of vines, in which lies</i> <span class="smcap">Mars</span>, <i>fast asleep. On
the steps of The World Inn sits</i> <span class="smcap">The Old Mother</span>
<i>watching the women of all nations who are sitting
sewing, chatting and tending babies in the center.
At the back a road winds across from left to right
and young girls are walking up and down with arms
around each other&#8217;s shoulders, singing and laughing.
The melody (&#8220;The Happy Farmer&#8221;) dies away gradually
and a church bell is heard&mdash;The Angelus. There
is a religious silence lasting for a moment or two.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_001.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">A WOMAN</p>

<p>The Angelus!</p>

<p class="center">ANOTHER</p>

<p>
Already day is gone<br />
And gone almost as soon as we began it.<br />
So goes it nowadays!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MOTHER,</p>

<p>
It was not so&mdash;<br />
Days did not hurry through sweet hours to joy<br />
When I was young, when I was bride and wife!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FIRST WOMAN</p>

<p>
Another blessed eventide is come<br />
To bring to happy women-folk at last<br />
Their weary men, all hungry for their supper.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">A CHILD</p>

<p>And some for me. I wants my suppie too!</p>

<p class="center">ANOTHER WOMAN</p>

<p>
Well, there&#8217;s a plenty. We are neighbors all<br />
And what one lacks the others can supply,<br />
For all the world will share the harvest feast.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MOTHER,</p>

<p>
Yea, all the world is here, or will be soon,<br />
Save my good mate and my five strapping lads<br />
Who were my world and rotted years ago.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE WOMAN</p>

<p>
There, mother, there&mdash;forget the old sad past,<br />
For all the world is sweet with harvest scent,<br />
And we are glad. Come, share with us our joy.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MOTHER,</p>

<p>
Forget? Forget? Who tells me to forget?<br />
A silly chit with everything to learn,<br />
A ninny who has lived while life is peace<br />
And therefore thinks that peace has always been<br />
As it is now. Say, girl, would you forget<br />
That man of yours torn from between your breasts<br />
And sent to splice with sabres and with shells?<br />
Could you forget a baby&#8217;s filthy death<br />
By plague or famine or infesting flies&mdash;<br />
A son&#8217;s abasement or a daughter&#8217;s rape&mdash;<br />
These things could you forget? I never shall.<br />
I would be of another race and kind,<br />
A woman who remembers what has been,<br />
Who knows that some day it may come again&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE FIRST WOMAN</p>

<p>
Poor soul, there&mdash;I am sorry. I did not know.<br />
We speak but foolishly to soothe a pain<br />
Which we have never felt.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MOTHER,</p>

<p>
Ah, pray that you<br />
May never, never know what I have known.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE WOMAN</p>

<p>
Ay, that I will. But come, and share our joy,<br />
For there is none to-night to presage woe.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MOTHER,</p>

<p>
None save myself. My old bones feel the cold&mdash;<br />
I sense a sorry blackening of the sun<br />
As night comes on, and any heap of fruit,<br />
Yes, any wagon load of yellow grain<br />
May hide from these old eyes their enemy.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE WOMAN</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>shrugging her shoulders</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>
Well, hide your grief, poor soul, if grieve you must;<br />
The men, who look for rest, will soon be home.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MOTHER,</p>

<p>
But not to me are any comings home,<br />
Although I keep The World Inn day by day....<br />
Yet &#8217;tis an ill thing and a sign of trouble<br />
For to be weeping when the men come home&mdash;<br />
The men, who should find smiles at set of sun,<br />
Who should be fed and coddled to their rest,<br />
These splendid children, when they come to us.<br />
I will make ready. I will dry my tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit The Old Mother into the World Inn. Voices are heard
without, coming nearer.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>The men enter in groups of twos and threes with dinner pails
and tools. They find their families or greet their sweethearts
and most of the happy couples go off down the road together at
the left. A few enter The World Inn. There is the rattle of
dishes, laughter and good cheer. The sun sinks perceptibly and
it grows darker. Enter Capital and Labor, quarreling.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">CAPITAL</p>

<p>
The pumpkins here are mine, good fellow, mine!<br />
I bought the seed, you know.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
I broke the earth&mdash;<br />
I strove with wind and frost and burning drought<br />
To make them grow more golden day by day.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">CAPITAL</p>

<p>
Tut, tut, man. That is nought. I own the land.<br />
You can but work it since I give consent.<br />
Small credit that a man does what he must<br />
If he would live.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>I gave my very life.</p>

<p class="center">CAPITAL</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>snapping his fingers</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>What is your life but like a billion more?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter Flip, costumed as gentleman of fashion</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<p>Are there indeed a billion Labors? If so, they will
soon keep you busy, Capital, old top, as busy as you
would like to keep them. You may grow thin&mdash;O
consummation devoutly to be wished! just a little bit
off the front&mdash;if these chaps keep on giving their lives
to your pumpkins. But if there be a billion just
alike&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">CAPITAL</p>

<p>In all the world there are but few like me!</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<p>Amen. So be it. Too many yous in one street car
would be the hell of a crowd, if you travelled in
street cars. And too many yous would be poor company
for one another. Wherever one man has a bulge
to his stomach, another must find his a siege and a
retreat. Well, friends, tell me your troubles, and I
will be a judge without the recall and a jury without
opinions to settle the case.</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>Both of us love the lady men call Trade.</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<p>The prettiest of all she-devils, she&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
And she is pliant ever to his will<br />
Who has most power. And we do both contend<br />
That power resides in pumpkins&mdash;but I claim&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="center">CAPITAL</p>

<p>Of pumpkins we were speaking. Be exact.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>To Flip</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>
He claims them all because he planted them.<br />
Could he have planted them without my aid<br />
Who pay the wage that buys his daily bread?<br />
</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
I furnish you, your bread, O Capital,<br />
And cake besides. You do not live on pumpkins!<br />
All, all is mine. Without me you would die.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<p>Peace, peace. Neither of you could live on pumpkins,
nor on power, nor would it suffice for either to have
complete possession of his heart&#8217;s desire, the harlot
Trade. To live on pumpkins&mdash;Lord, what a diet!
Thick&mdash;yellow&mdash;mushy&mdash;with never a hint of stimulation
for the uplift of the soul. We must have souls,
nowadays, for it is the thing. They are nearly as
common as tuberculosis, and quite as tragic. But
those who go awhoring think not deeply of their souls
lest they repent. And I would not feed my soul on
pumpkin to outwit Capital and appease Labor&mdash;no
not I. Rather would I turn viticulturist and try the
grape cure!</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
Raisins or pumpkins, it is all the same;<br />
These things are mine, for I have made them be.<br />
I, I deliver earth of what she bears<br />
And am chief nurse at Nature&#8217;s lying-in.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<p>A very shocking nurse I will be bound&mdash;to go from
the sacredness of Nature&#8217;s childbed, to woo Trade&mdash;verily,
if the wages of sin be death, that would be
going from the cradle to the grave!</p>

<p class="center">CAPITAL</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>self-righteously</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>For my part I make no pretense at all!</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>slapping Labor on the shoulder</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Come, Labor, not so seriously, old top. It is not in
good form to care so much. We are grown light of
touch, to-day, and laugh at bombast. And as for the
two of you, a true philosopher would tell you that, if
you were a little more glib and smug, and Capital a
little more smug and glib, men could scarce estimate
the value of the one over the other? And what matters
a label if, by accident, or skill, or the lack of it,
the one of you can change places, sometimes, with the
other? And what matters the ownership if I can so
hamper your operations as to take too much toll
from both?</p>

<p class="center">CAPITAL</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>sulky and bewildered</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>I do but set my label on my own&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>A dollar sign on earth and sea and sky!</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<p>A dollar sign is a good thing anywhere. I&#8217;d wear it
over all the sense I have. And, were I to fill your
place, Capital, I should be content with dollar signs
and labels, and not dispute with poor Labor about
his pumpkin pie. I would even give him more than
one slice if he wanted it. He would then think himself
rich, and lapse into content for an aeon or two.
And surely there is more than one way of winning a
lady?</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
Be silent, Flip; I do not like your wit.<br />
This is The World Field that I till and sow<br />
And woo and threaten, and at last, coerce,<br />
Until it is the wife of my command<br />
To bear me children of my days of toil.<br />
Shall I be cheated of these children, then,<br />
With smiling face and showy courtesy?<br />
I tell you no. For I am grown too strong&mdash;<br />
And I am wiser than I used to be&mdash;<br />
I could make garbage of his flabby paunch<br />
And beat his brains to swill!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>with mock alarm, running to left and calling</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Trade! Trade! you jade&mdash;Come here and see your
precious lovers fight....</p>

<p>
Pumpkins? Who cares for pumpkins? No&mdash;not I.<br />
I only mentioned them to keep you busy,<br />
For I can hardly settle with you yet,<br />
Nor judge the better lover of the twain.<br />
For, at this time, great kings take thought for me&mdash;<br />
Princes and leaders of the people crave<br />
My kindness&mdash;and myself. You two must wait.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
Know then it was not all for you I spoke,<br />
But for a principle&mdash;for that I fight.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>Labor turns up his sleeves, clenches his fist and takes a stride
or two toward Capital, who is frightened and blows a whistle in
alarm. Enter Religion from The World Inn, a little man in
black, carrying a book, who trots up to Capital as to a master.
Capital pinions his two arms and holds Religion in front of him.
Labor laughs roughly and begins to pull off his shirt.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
Come, Flip, your wit is all too deep for me,<br />
But, if Religion is to second him,<br />
I would depend on you in my good cause.<br />
Come, help me strip and then, a fight, a fight!<br />

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>Hesitates, goes to help him, speaks gently.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>A fight is a noisy affair, Labor, and wakes many
sleepers. There is one over in the corner who should
not on any account be disturbed. For, once wakened,
he is hard to quiet.</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>You speak too late&mdash;come&mdash;help&mdash;my shirt is tight!</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>seizing the shirt, gives one tug and then withdraws in haste,
holding his nose.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>You are too sweaty, Labor. Sorry, old top, but I
can&#8217;t stand it. Muscles are a rare thing nowadays,
and I would like to see yours, since you are not afraid
to waken that old fear under the vines. And these
modern epics are amusing, wherein Achilles carries
a dinner pail and Ulysses turns syndicalist. But, if
I must act as a second and pull off men&#8217;s shirts, commend
me to a man who has money enough to buy
soap and time for a bath, and that, though he were
not half so good to look upon.</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>outraged, and flinging his shirt at Flip</i>)</p></blockquote>

Take you my sweat upon your silly face<br />

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(<i>Retreating and holding Religion in front of himself</i>)</p></blockquote>

Preach me a gospel to this fighting fool,<br />
A pretty gospel of The Prince of Peace,<br />
Religion, you whom I have paid and kept.<br />

<p class="center">RELIGION</p>

<p>
I will, I will&mdash;but wait. For I must think&mdash;<br />
The Word has not the weight that once it had.<br />
Come, Labor, my good man, what is amiss?<br />
Come, come, no fighting&mdash;that is very wrong....<br />
Be meek and humble as the good book says!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">LABOR</p>

<p>
I loved the good book and its precepts well<br />
In the old days when first my faith in you<br />
Kept me from fighting save at your behest<br />
And for your sake. I listened to you, then.<br />
You were the Light and in your way I walked,<br />
Loving and dreaming; but the dreams are gone<br />
Like your old stature, fervency and power.<br />
Sermons in livery I will not heed,<br />
A flunkey&#8217;s stale rebuke I do abhor!<br />
A bought man cannot teach the strong and free&mdash;<br />
My soul is pure, and will not brook your touch!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FLIP</p>

<p>His soul? Where is it, I wonder? They always talk
about them, but where are they? Two dunderheads
and an adlepate trying to make righteousness out of
their own inclinations by converse about souls! bah!</p>

One would think your derivative graces almost funny

want <i>you</i> to be funny. They would have you large

corpses, but red-blooded men, having given themselves

he has been sleeping, women have indulged their husbands
and borne too many children, and the world is
full to overflowing; men have indulged their families
in new luxuries of all kinds. All fear temperance as
they fear death, for, like death it curbs desire. The
Soul of Man, of whom we constantly hear, has not yet
made himself conspicuous, although the women&#8217;s

certain rooms in The World Inn to accommodate
more strangers, or else of reducing the number

nor will they give you a good background for the acting

Washed by our women&#8217;s tears, we fain would see<br />
Another era of mankind made new,<br />
Young Titans, strong enough to war on war,<br />
This hoary curse from the stringy throat of Mars<br />
To answer and to silence and to choke!<br />
</p>

<p class="center">OTHER MEN</p>

<p>Mother, the way&mdash;the upward way from Hell!</p>

<p class="center">THE OLD MOTHER,</p>

<p>
I&#8217;ll show it, thankfully, and, if I do,<br />
I can go gaily, gladly to my grave<br />
As one who treads a quickstep of her youth.<br />
See, children, that strange figure, Soul of Man,<br />
In bonds to our arch enemy and his?<br />
He is our friend, and all our life would share<br />
If we would only take him for our own.<br />
There is no morning made by sun and sea<br />
And towering mountains, larksong, flower breath<br />
And rapture, but his coming into it<br />
Can give a finer and diviner joy.<br />
There is no darkness, damp and fraught with death,<br />
Down-bearing, stifling, but his coming makes<br />
A rift of light, an easement of the strain.<br />
Now Mars, his foe, is held in ugly sleep,<br />
Full-fed on thin, raw flesh of women&#8217;s babes,<br />
Deep drunken on the sap of many hearts&mdash;<br />
Be not deceived, for he will wake again,<br />
Unless ye learn of this good Soul of Man<br />
How to defy this Mars, and get you peace.<br />
Children, commend you to the Soul of Man.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">A MAN</p>

<p>How can we free you, free you, Soul of Man?</p>

<p class="center">SOUL OF MAN</p>

<p>
I tremble&mdash;for my hour of joy is near....<br />
Ah, can it be that I shall rise at last,<br />
Gay winged and glorious with the rising sun,<br />
To hover where mankind shall bloom anew<br />
In The World Field where only stubble was?<br />
Hearken! For now, together ye must go,<br />
Not here a few and there a few, but all,<br />
And hale him forth, this monster butcher, now,<br />
While he is full and has no lust to feed,<br />
Yes, hale him forth into the light and look,<br />
And looking, know him truly as he is.<br />
If for that look he wake, defy his power,<br />
For your own sakes fight one more fight for peace.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">A MAN</p>

<p>
Alas, we are too weak for this god Mars,<br />
And some of us have known him all too well.<br />
</p>

<p class="center">SOUL OF MAN</p>

<p>
Who does my bidding has no sense of fear&mdash;<br />
For all the stars will shine into his night<br />
And all the winds acclaim him to the end.<br />
And this was true of Socrates and Christ,<br />
Of Lincoln and of all great harvesters<br />
In The World Field. It shall be so for you<br />
On the same terms of brave obedience.<br />
Do ye my bidding and ye shall be free<br />
And I, to live and grow with you, forever.<br />

I was a sinner who had nibbled Truth<br />

The loss of your allegiance was the stroke<br />

<p>&#8220;A rich contralto voice singing out of the deepest experiences of life.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Poetry.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The emotions are human, lofty and honorable; their voicing is sincere, passionate, and at
times exalted.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Twentieth Century Magazine.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Few of the modern poets can so easily convince the doubting ones of the necessity of their
vocation as the author of this slender volume of verse.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Chicago Daily News.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Aside from their poetic beauty, the verses possess a dignity, wholesomeness and outspoken
valiance that carry conviction. Sincerity is their dominant note; they are the utterance of one who
has heard &#8216;the quiet but far-reaching voice of truth.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Craftsman.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The vigor of its thought raises it above questions of technique, and it is poetry unquestionably,
inevitably, simply because it is the authentic voice of womanhood proclaiming itself in the
unfaltering accents of real passion.&#8221;&mdash;Harold Monro in <i>The Poetry Review</i> (London, 1912).</p>

<p>&#8220;Sincere, unconventional, forthright verse.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Oakland Enquirer.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A human document, even a social document.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The New York Times.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Distinctly worthy of note.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a new song under the sun, a woman&#8217;s love song which neither pretends to be a
man&#8217;s love song, nor confines itself to feelings which most men are accustomed to think of women
as having. It is solar, not lunar; it is clear with its own light and warm with its own fire.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The
Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The poems in this volume are as meat and wine to literary tastes.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Albany Times-Union.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Not only do we have the woman spirit here, but a poetical spirit of no mean sort.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Zion&#8217;s
Herald.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is clear, true poetry, without aping, effusiveness, or striving for effect; the refraction of
momentous personal experience through a richly-dowered soul. It is also precious as an exquisite
voicing of pure womanliness in its highest phase. It is worthy not only to be enjoyed, but to be
studied as a clue to the soul of the coming woman.&#8221;&mdash;Edward A. Ross, Author of &#8220;Sin and Society,&#8221;
&#8220;The Changing Chinese,&#8221; etc., etc.</p>

<p>&#8220;No clearer voice than that of Marguerite Wilkinson sings today of the coming woman and of
the democracy we are working for. &#8216;In Vivid Gardens,&#8217; a glimpse into the souls of women, was
her first book of poems.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Life and Labor.</i></p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
